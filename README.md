# Krynapsis

This library serves to encrypt and decrypt text in 2 lines using the Gauss-Jacques algorithm which is one of the safest algorithms.


## Features
- Out of the box encrypt/decrypt text
- Use one of the most secure encryption algorithms
- More features coming soon..

## Usage

### Initialize the library

There are 2 ways to start the library.
1. Pass the matrix in a string

```java
Krynapsis.init("[49,66,36][57,7,65][78,13,54]");
```

2. TODO: Generate the matrix automatically and store it in the device.
```java
Krynapsis.init(context);
```

### Encrypt and decrypt text

Now you can encrypt and decrypt the text you need.

```java
String encrypted = Krynapsis.encrypt(text);
//or
String decrypted = Krynapsis.decrypt(encrypted);
```
